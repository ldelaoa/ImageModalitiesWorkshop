#modifies an image by limiting its pixel intensity values to a specified range
#It then modifies the image by setting all pixel values below the lower bound to that bound and all pixel values above the upper bound to that bound. 
#This operation is commonly called 'clamping' or 'clipping' and it ensures pixel values are within a defined range.
#args:
#image: This is expected to be a SimpleITK image object.
#lower_bound: This is the minimum pixel value that will be allowed.
#upperbound: This is the maximum pixel value that will be allowed.
